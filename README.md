##Dependencies
PXG depends on:
* GLM ( <http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.5/index.html> ) - OpenGL Mathematics
* SOIL ( <http://lonesock.net/soil.html> ) - Simple OpenGL Image Library
* SDL2 ( <https://www.libsdl.org> ) - Simple DirectMedia Layer
* Bullet Physics ( <http://bulletphysics.org> ) - Realtime Physics Simulation Library
* Freetype2 ( <http://www.freetype.org/freetype2> ) - Font Engine

PXG also makes use of some C++11 features.

##Documentation
It is too early to write documentation. Examples will be available soon.
